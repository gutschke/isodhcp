.SH DESCRIPTION
.B isodhcp
is a specialized DHCP server designed for secure Linux routers hosting guest,
IoT, or untrusted networks. It prioritizes Layer 3 client isolation and strictly
controls network topology based on client classification.

It operates in three distinct modes:

.B 1. Isolated Mode (Standard):
The default behavior. Assigns clients a \fB/32\fR subnet mask. The server
injects a specific host route into the kernel for each client. This forces all
traffic to pass through the gateway, enabling strict isolation.

.B 2. Micro-Segmentation Mode (Compatibility):
For "Legacy" devices that malfunction with /32 masks (e.g., game consoles), the
server dynamically allocates a tiny \fB/30\fR subnet (4 IPs). It creates a
secondary IP alias on the router interface to serve as the gateway for that
specific client.

.B 3. Playground Mode:
A reserved, contiguous subnet carved out of the main pool for devices that
require standard Layer 2 visibility (e.g., Chromecast, Apple TV). Clients in
the playground share a standard subnet mask (e.g., /26) and can communicate
with each other, even if global isolation is enforced.

.PP
The server features built-in DoS protection (quarantine), ARP conflict
detection, and robust integration with \fBnftables\fR for high-performance
firewalling.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR \fIdns\fR, \fB\-\-dns\fR \fIdns\fR
The DNS server IP address to offer clients. If omitted, the server parses
\fI/etc/resolv.conf\fR (and systemd-resolved upstream configurations) to find a
valid IPv4 nameserver.

.TP
\fB\-f\fR \fIpath\fR, \fB\-\-lease-file\fR \fIpath\fR
Path to the JSON file where lease state is persisted. Defaults to
\fIdhcp_leases_{INTERFACE}.json\fR in the current working directory. The server writes to
this file on allocation, release, and shutdown. To minimize disk wear, renewals
are only written if the expiration time changes significantly.

.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIinterface\fR, \fB\-\-interface\fR \fIinterface\fR
The network interface to listen on (e.g., \fIeth1\fR, \fIwlan0\fR). The server
binds specifically to this interface to avoid conflicts with other DHCP servers
on the host. Defaults to \fIguest\fR.

.TP
\fB\-p\fR \fIpool\fR, \fB\-\-pool\fR \fIpool\fR
The CIDR range of IPs to allocate (e.g., \fI10.100.0.0/24\fR). If omitted, the
server attempts to auto-detect the subnet configured on the interface.

.TP
\fB\-s\fR \fIserver_ip\fR, \fB\-\-server-ip\fR \fIserver_ip\fR
The IP address of the router (gateway). If omitted, the server attempts to
auto-detect the primary IP address assigned to the interface specified
by \fB\-i\fR.

.TP
\fB\-t\fR \fIseconds\fR, \fB\-\-lease-time\fR \fIseconds\fR
The duration of the DHCP lease in seconds. Defaults to \fI3600\fR (1 hour).

.TP
\fB\-\-compat\-mac\fR \fImac\fR
Treat the specified MAC address as a "legacy" client. Instead of receiving the
standard strict \fB/32\fR netmask (client isolation), this device will be
assigned a \fB/30\fR micro-segment with a netmask of \fB255.255.255.252\fR).
.br
Useful for older printers, embedded devices, or game consoles that refuse to
accept a gateway outside of their own subnet mask.
.br
Example: \fI\-\-compat\-mac 00:11:22:33:44:55\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-compat\-oui\fR \fIoui\fR
Treat any device whose MAC address starts with this 3-byte prefix
(Organizationally Unique Identifier) as a legacy client.
.br
The OUI format is \fIAA:BB:CC\fR. Case is insensitive.
.br
Example: \fI\-\-compat\-oui B8:27:EB\fR (Raspberry Pi Foundation)

.TP
\fB\-\-compat\-vendor\fR \fIstring\fR
Treat any device sending a DHCP Vendor Class Identifier (option 60) containing
this substring as a legacy client.
.br
Useful for broad classes of devices or operating systems known to struggle with
unnumbered interfaces.
.br
Example: \fI\-\-compat\-vendor "MSFT 5.0"\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-masquerade\-mac\fR \fImac\fR
The device with this MAC will have their traffic source NAT'd (SNAT) by the
router. Traffic destined for these clients will appear to originate from the
gateway IP itself, rather than the original sender.

.TP
\fB\-\-masquerade\-oui\fR \fIprefix\fR
Apply source NAT to any device whose MAC address starts with this
3-byte prefix.

.TP
\fB\-\-masquerade\-vendor\fR \fIprefix\fR
Apply source NAT to any device that matches this DHCP Vendor Class Identifier.

.TP
\fB\-\-nft\-set\-playground\fR \fIname\fR
The daemon can populate named \fBNFTables\fR sets for integration with
firewall rules. Each option can only be given once and specifies an
optional name for a set (e.g., \fI"inet filter iso_clients"\fR). The set will
not be created if it doesn't already exist. \fB\-\-nft\-set\-playground\fR names
the set for playground (typically \fB/24\fR .. \fB/29\fR) clients, that are
not isolated from each other.

.TP
\fB\-\-nft\-set\-playground\-subnet\fR \fIname\fR
Set for the subnet that contains all playground clients.

.TP
\fB\-\-nft\-set\-isolated\fR \fIname\fR
Set for isolated \fB/32\fR clients.

.TP
\fB\-\-nft\-set\-compat\fR \fIname\fR
Set for legacy \fB/30\fR clients.

.TP
\fB\-\-nft\-set\-gateway\fR \fIname\fR
Set for the dynamic gateway IPs created for \fB/30\fR blocks.

.TP
\fB\-\-nft\-set\-network\fR \fIname\fR
Set for the network addresses of \fB/30\fR blocks.

.TP
\fB\-\-nft\-set\-broadcast\fR \fIname\fR
Set for the broadcast addresses of \fB/30\fR blocks.

.TP
\fB\-\-nft\-set\-subnet\fR \fIname\fR
Set for the CIDR blocks of \fB/30\fR allocations. \fBNote:\fR This set must
have the \fBinterval\fR flag enabled in \fBNFTables\fR.

.TP
\fB\-\-static\fR \fImac=ip[,hostname][,compat][,masquerade][,playground]\fR
Map a MAC to a specific IP. Can be repeated.
.br
\fBhostname\fR: (Optional) string to log for this device.
.br
\fBcompat\fR: (Optional) flag to force this device into legacy or
compatibility mode.
.br
\fBmasquerade\fR: (Optional) enable source NAT for this client.
.br
\fBplayground\R: (Optional) Assign to the shared playground subnet. IP must be
within the calculated playground range.
.br
.B Note:
For \fIcompat\fR entries, the IP must be the ".2" offset of a valid
\fB/30\fR block (e.g., .2, .6, .10). The server will reserve the entire 4-IP
block immediately at startup.
.br
Static entries are initialized immediately at startup. The server configures the
interface, routes, and firewall rules before the client even connects. These
addresses are permanently removed from the free pool.

.TP
\fB\-\-dhcp\-option\fR \fICODE,TYPE,VALUE\fR
Inject custom options into DHCP replies.
.br
\fBTYPE:\fR \fIip\fR, \fIips\fR (list), \fIstr\fR, \fIint8\fR, \fIint16\fR, \fIint32\fR, \fIhex\fR.
.br
\fBVALUE:\fR The data. For \fIhex\fR, colons are optional.

.TP
\fB\-\-playground\-size\fR \fIn\fR
Number of IPs to reserve. Must be > 5. The server rounds up to the next CIDR
boundary (e.g., 50 -> 64 -> /26). If size equals the pool size, the server
behaves like a traditional DHCP server (no isolation).

.TP
\fB\-\-playground\-mac\fR \fImac\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-playground\-oui\fR \fIprefix\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-playground\-vendor\fR \fIstring\fR
Assign matching clients to the playground. An empty string for vendor matches
\fIall\fR clients.

.TP
\fB\-\-hook\-file\fR \fIpath\fR
Path to an executable script (e.g., shell or Python) that is invoked whenever a
lease is added or released. See \fBHOOK SCRIPT\fR below for details.

.TP
\fB\-\-isolation\fR \fI{on,off,system}\fR
In the vast majority of cases, the job of \fBisodhcp\fR is done as soon as it
sends all traffic through the layer 3 router. Policy decisions are supposed to
be enforced by a third-party firewall. \fB\-\-isolation\fR provides minimal
built-in firewall support for the \fBforward\fR chain policy:
.br
\fBon\R: DROPs intra-subnet traffic except for playground-to-playground.
.br
\fBoff\fR: ACCEPTs intra-subnet traffic.
.br
\fBsystem\fR: Adds no rules and relies on external firewall.

.SH HOOK SCRIPT
If \fB\-\-hook\-file\fR is specified, the server executes the script
asynchronously on lease changes.

.PP

.PP
\fB7. Advanced hybrid configuration\fP
.br
Run on \fIguest0\fR. Treat Nintendo Switch (OUI \fI98:B6:E9\fR) and Windows XP
clients as legacy. Assign a static IP to a client that can't handle /32 routes.
Populate \fBNFTables\fR sets for firewalling:
.IP

.PP
\fB10. Static legacy reservation\fP
.br
Assign a printer to 10.100.0.10. Force it to use a /30 subnet (occupying
10.100.0.8/30) because it doesn't support /32:
.IP
.B isodhcp \-\-static 00:11:22:33:44:55=10.100.0.10,printer,compat

.SH FILES
.TP
.I ./dhcp_leases_{INTERFACE}.json
The default location for lease persistence. Ensure the user running the daemon
has write permissions to this file (or directory).

.SH SECURITY & PERMISSIONS
To run \fBisodhcp\fR as an unprivileged user, the process requires the
following Linux capabilities:

.TP
.B CAP_NET_RAW
Required to open raw sockets for sending/receiving DHCP packets via Scapy.

.TP
.B CAP_NET_ADMIN
Required to modify the kernel routing table (adding/removing /32 routes via
\fBnetlink\fR).

.TP
.B CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
Required to bind to port 67 (optional, depending on implementation
details, but recommended).

.PP
In a systemd unit file, these can be assigned via:
.br
\fIAmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_RAW CAP_NET_ADMIN CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE\fR

.SH NFTABLES CONFIGURATION
To use the \fB\-\-nft\-set\-subnet\fR feature, the target set must be capable
of storing intervals (CIDRs). Example configuration in \fI/etc/nftables.conf\fR:

.nf
table inet filter {
    set iso_clients { type ipv4_addr; }
    set compat_subnets {
        type ipv4_addr
        flags interval
    }
}
.fi

.SH AVAHI / MDNS INTERACTION
By default, this server disables \fBPromiscuous Mode\fR on the raw socket to
prevent the OS from flagging a "link change" event. This prevents local mDNS
daemons (like Avahi) from flushing their cache every time the server restarts.

To ensure proper mDNS reflection between the isolated network and a trusted
network, ensure the router interface has a valid IP address within the pool
range (e.g., \fI10.100.0.1/24\fR), even though clients are assigned \fI/30\fR
and \fI/32\fR masks.
